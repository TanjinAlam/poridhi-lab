# Troubleshooting Guide for Microservices VXLAN Project

This document provides troubleshooting tips and solutions for common issues encountered during the development and deployment of the Microservices VXLAN Project.

## Common Issues

### 1. Service Not Responding
- **Symptoms**: One or more services are not responding to requests.
- **Solutions**:
  - Check the service logs for any error messages.
  - Ensure that the service is running by checking the container status.
  - Verify that the service is correctly configured in the NGINX gateway.

### 2. Network Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms**: Services cannot communicate with each other.
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure that the VXLAN configuration is correctly set up.
  - Check the routing tables to confirm that routes are properly defined.
  - Use the `network-diagnostics.sh` script to identify any network issues.

### 3. Deployment Failures
- **Symptoms**: Deployment scripts fail to execute successfully.
- **Solutions**:
  - Review the output of the `deploy-services.sh` script for error messages.
  - Ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly.
  - Check for any missing dependencies or configuration files.

### 4. Configuration Errors

- **Solutions**:
  - Review the configuration files in the `configs` directory for any syntax errors.
  - Ensure that the correct configuration file is being used for each service.
  - Validate the NGINX configuration using `nginx -t` command.

### 5. Performance Issues
- **Symptoms**: Services are slow or unresponsive under load.
- **Solutions**:
  - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) of the containers.
  - Optimize service code and database queries.
  - Consider scaling services horizontally by increasing the number of replicas.
